Palimpsest Maps API

This is very much a work in progress. The goal is to host all of The Archimedes Palimpsest (archimedespalimpsest.net) imagery and make it accessible via the google maps interface. 

The current stash of 4000+ images, all of which are between 50 and 250 MB, are rather difficult to work with in their currently hosted environment. The hope is that by making them accessible through a google maps interface, scholars of Math, Ancient Greek, and other pertinent fields who may not have the technical expertise or time will be able to peruse or even contribute to the body of scholarly work surrounding this manuscript. A secondary hope is that whatever tools end up being useful here could be used elsewhere for other projects that might benefit from increasing the accessibility of large (probably scientific) imagery data sets.

There are known issues with rendering in IE due to a lack of support of outerWidth & outerHeight method/properties that should be easy to fix, but is not a high priority.

Scripts:
========
See the scripts folder in imgtile project
========

The new recommended way to fetch and process assets is via rsync, and the updated scripts in the seperate imgtile project.

REMOTES:
rsync://archimedespalimpsest.net/archimedes
rsync://digitalgalen.net/DigitalGalen
rsync {REMOTE} {localpath=./} --recursive --verbose --progress (--update)

or you can explore via:
rsync rysnc://archimedespalimpsest.net 
rsync rysnc://digitalgalen.net

It may also be worthwhile to only rsync .tif files, (and eventually tei and linemapping files)

Since the datasets here are relatively large (~300GB), you will most likely want to run these in a screen session.
